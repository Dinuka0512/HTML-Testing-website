    <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure of web pages by using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML is the backbone of every web page and is essential for presenting content on the internet.</p>

    <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a web page written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, design, and visual appearance of web pages, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS allows developers to create visually appealing and responsive websites by separating the content structure from the visual style.</p>

    <h2 id="js">JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language used to add interactivity, behavior, and functionality to web pages. It is a client-side language, meaning it runs in the browser, allowing developers to create interactive elements such as forms, animations, and dynamic content updates. JavaScript is essential for modern web development and is widely used in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

    <h2 id="react">React</h2>
    <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to build complex and interactive web applications. React's virtual DOM and efficient rendering system provide fast performance, making it a popular choice for front-end development.</p>

    <h2 id = "angular">Angular</h2>
    <p>Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page applications, developed by Google. It is based on TypeScript and provides a comprehensive solution for building dynamic, modern web apps. Angular offers tools for routing, forms, HTTP requests, and testing, as well as a powerful dependency injection system. It's widely used for creating large-scale, enterprise-level web applications.</p>
